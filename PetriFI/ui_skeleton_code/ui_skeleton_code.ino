//Team Petri-FI UI Code
  //This is the very rough and unfinished draft of the UI functionality code. 


//For right now, the variables are hardcoded into here so we don't have to set up the whole system to test.
int startingTemp = 30; //this is only used at the starting screen to show the inside temp of the container
int temp; //keeps track of temp inside container - will eventually be the thermistor reading
int runTime; //the time that is set at the beginning of the run
int elapsedTime; //the time that the device has been running for

void setup() {
//will fill this in later once we integrate the UI code into the main code
}

  /* This code works by checking the electrical state (i.e. time, temperature) and the button state (i.e. the value
   *  (0 or 1) of the three buttons).
  */

//********run startup screen first before entering into the switch statement

//*****check current temp, display, output OK button press
//startingTemp = read temp
//buttonState = startupScreen(startingTemp)

//now start the loop

  //check electrical state - gives temp, time

  //check button state


  //switch(elec state)
      //switch(button state)
          //use the minicubator code for detecting button presses
